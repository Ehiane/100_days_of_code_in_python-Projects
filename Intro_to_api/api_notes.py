## API stands for Application Programming Interface
"""
An API is basically a resource package, that could be a set of commands, functions,
protocols and objects that is used to create software or interact with 
an external system.

#Simple Analogy:
lets say you go to a restaurant.
Your tummy is the software you are building, the menu is the API because it has all the information of the food you want to get
the Kitchen is the external system that makes the food. your request is your order, it's response is your food.
---
it's like a bridge between your program and external system. 
You request smth(provided that you follow the rules) and it sends a response.  

#most companies have their own api

#API endpoints
think about it as a location. If you wanted to get money out of a bank, 
you'd need to know what that bank is and what is its address.
that address in API lingo is the API endpoint. It is usually just a url

#API requests
imagine going to a bank and you want to withdraw money out. Thats an API request. 
basically requesting for external data

#difference between API's and Middleware
Middleware acts as an intermediary layer between different software applications and componenets to provide services
and functions that facilitate communication, data exchange and interaction between applications.
examples are databases, servers, etc. 

Middleware can use an API to accomplish its task. so An Api can also be described as Functionality of Middleware to obtain data from external systems.

so get request is a simple api request that usually requires no authentication.
