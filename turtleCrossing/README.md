# üê¢üõ£Ô∏èüöó|Turtle Cross Game

Turtle Cross is a simple arcade game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The objective of the game is to control the turtle and make it cross the road while avoiding the moving cars. The game gets progressively harder with each level, as the cars move faster.

2. Ensure you have Python (>= 3.6) installed on your system.

```

## Usage

Run the game by executing `main.py` in your Python environment.

```
python main.py

```

## Gameplay

In Turtle Cross, you control the turtle character, represented by a green turtle shape, using the arrow keys. Your objective is to move the turtle up the screen and cross the road without colliding with any of the moving cars. As the game progresses, the cars move faster, making it more challenging to cross safely.

If the turtle collides with any car, the game ends, and a "GAME OVER" message is displayed on the screen. However, if the turtle successfully crosses the road and reaches the finish line, you will advance to the next level, and the cars will move even faster.

The game continues until the turtle collides with a car or until the player decides to close the window.

## Controls

- Use the **Up arrow key** to move the turtle upward.
