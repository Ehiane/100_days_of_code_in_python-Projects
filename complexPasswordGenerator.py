Understanding 
In this list comprehension below 👇, chr(x) is used to convert the ASCII value x to its corresponding character. 
The range for lowercase letters is obtained using ord('a') and ord('z'), 
while the range for uppercase letters is obtained using ord('A') and ord('Z').
By iterating over these ranges and converting each ASCII value to a character, we can generate the desired list of letters.
"""
