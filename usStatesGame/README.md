# ‚ùìüó∫Ô∏èüåé|U.S. States Game 

This Python Turtle program is a simple game that allows the user to guess the names of the U.S. states by typing the states' name in the dialog box. The program reads state data from a CSV file, displays the U.S. map, and prompts the user to guess the names of the states. If the user's guess is correct, the state name will be displayed on the map at its location. The game continues until the user guesses all 50 states or types "quit" to end the game.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script to start the game.
2. A window will pop up showing the blank U.S. map.
3. Type the name of the state you want to guess and press Enter.
4. If your guess is correct, the state name will be revealed on the map.
5. Keep guessing until you find all 50 states or type "quit" to end the game.

## Game Features

- The game uses Python's Turtle module to display the map and handle user input.
- The state data is read from a CSV file ("50_states.csv") using the Pandas module, providing a structured database of state information.
- The program displays the number of correct guesses out of 50 states on the window title.
- If the user types "quit," the game will end, and all the unguessed states will be revealed on the map.
- The user's final score is displayed on the map at the end of the game.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module
- Pandas module

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```

pip install pandas
```
3. Save the provided Python script in a file (e.g., "us_states_game.py").
4. Download the CSV file ("50_states.csv") and the blank U.S. map image ("blank_states_img.gif") and place them in the same directory as the Python script.

## Command to Run the Game:
```

python main.py
```


## Note

- The game will keep running after you finish guessing all 50 states. Close the window to exit the game.

Enjoy the U.S. States Game and have fun learning the geography of the United States!
