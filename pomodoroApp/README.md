## Introduction

Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer application! This program is designed to help you manage your time using the Pomodoro Technique, a popular time management method. This README provides an overview of the application, its features, installation instructions, and more.

## Features

### 1. Effective Time Management

The Pomodoro Timer application uses the Pomodoro Technique to help you work efficiently. It divides your work into intervals, allowing you to focus for a set period followed by short breaks.

### 2. Customizable Work and Break Durations

You can set your preferred durations for work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks. This flexibility lets you tailor the technique to your personal productivity style.

### 3. Visual and Audible Alerts

The timer provides visual cues through changing text color and displays a countdown clock. Additionally, you'll receive audible alerts at the end of each interval.

### 4. Progress Tracking

The application keeps track of your completed work sessions and displays checkmarks to indicate your progress throughout the day.
