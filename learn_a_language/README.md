The FlashCard App is a language learning tool designed to help users learn new words and phrases in a foreign language through an interactive and engaging experience. This app allows users to practice vocabulary in a fun and intuitive way, making language learning an enjoyable journey.

## Features

- **Random Word Pairs**: The app displays random word pairs from a data source, consisting of foreign language words and their translations.

- **Dual-Language Flashcards**: Each flashcard has two sides - one displaying the foreign language word and the other showing its translation in the user's base language.

- **Interactive UI**: Users can click on buttons to indicate whether they know or don't know the translation of the displayed word. The app responds by showing the translation side of the flashcard.

- **Countdown Timer**: A timer adds an element of challenge to the learning process. Users have a limited time to guess the translation before the app reveals the answer.

- **Progress Tracking**: Known and unknown words are tracked separately and saved to corresponding CSV files for future reference and review.

## Getting Started

To run the FlashCard App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.7 or higher is recommended).

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
```

```
4. Run the app by executing the `flashcard_app.py` script:

5. The app window will open, displaying a flashcard with a foreign language word. Click the "Start" button to begin, and use the "Know" and "Don't Know" buttons to indicate your guess.

6. Enjoy learning and improving your vocabulary in your chosen foreign language!

## Customization

You can customize the FlashCard App to fit your learning preferences:

- Change the Foreign Language: Modify the `foreign_language` variable in the code to choose from available languages such as Igbo, Yoruba, or Hausa.

- Data Source: You can provide your own data source by creating a CSV file with columns named "Igbo" and "English", containing word pairs.

- Adjust Timer: Change the `GUESS_TIME` variable to adjust the countdown timer for each flashcard.
