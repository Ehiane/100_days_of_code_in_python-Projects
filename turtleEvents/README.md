## How to Play

1. The game will prompt the user to enter their bet by choosing a color.
2. Six turtles of different colors will race from left to right on the screen.
3. The turtles move forward with random speeds.
4. Once all turtles reach the right edge of the screen, the race ends.
5. The script determines the winning turtle and compares it with the user's bet.
6. If the user's bet matches the winning color, they win. Otherwise, they lose.

## Dependencies

- The script uses the `turtle` module, which provides a turtle graphics system.
- It also uses the `random` module to generate random speeds for the turtles.

## How to Run

To run the script, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed by running the command `python --version` in your terminal. If Python is not installed, download and install it from the official Python website.
2. Save the provided Python code into a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `turtle_race.py`).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Run the script using the command `python turtle_race.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to place your bet and watch the turtle race.

## Further Customization

- You can modify the `colors` list to add or remove colors for the turtles.
- Adjust the `y_positions` list to change the vertical positions of the turtles.
- The script uses random speeds for the turtles. You can modify the `turtle_speeds` list to change the range of possible speeds.
- Feel free to modify the game logic to add new features or change the behavior of the turtles.
