*Rules:
*If the sum of your cards surpass 21, it's a bust and the player loses.
*while the total sum of your cards is lesser than 17, you must draw another card.
*if 17 or greater then you can submit your deck.
* who ever's card is lesser than 21 but higher than the other player wins.
* if both draw, no one wins the round
* if any of the player submits a 21, that player automatically wins
* all non-numerical cards represent 10, except an ACE(A);
* in this version of the game, the cards are not being removed from the deck
* They're no joker cards
