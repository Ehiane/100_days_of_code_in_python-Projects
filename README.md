# [ 🔗: 100_days_of_code_in_python-Projects](https://github.com/Ehiane/100_days_of_code_in_python-Projects/tree/main)

Welcome to my repository for the projects completed during my "100 Days of Code in Python" course. These projects showcase my progress and mastery of Python programming concepts. 

**[ 🪨🗒️✂️ |Day 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://github.com/Ehiane/100_days_of_code_in_python-Projects/tree/main/RPS)**
> Developed a graphical version of the classic game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" using Python, incorporating the random module to generate computer moves.

**[ 🤐🔒🎰 |Day 5: Password-Generator](passwordGenerator)**
> Implemented a password generator that utilizes the range function to customize the length and complexity of generated passwords.

**[🎮✏️🪢 |Day 7: Hangman](Hangman)**
> Created a text-based version of the game "Hangman," focusing on flowchart design and string manipulation techniques.

**[👨🏿‍💼💼💰 |Day 9: Blind-Auction](blindAuction)**
> Built a blind auction program using dictionaries and functions, enabling participants to place bids and determine the highest bidder.

**[⌨️🧮 ➗ |Day 10: txtBasedCalc](txtBasedCalc)**
> Developed a text-based calculator application that incorporates functions with outputs, loops, and informative docstrings.

**[Day 11 (🧢🪨| Capstone): txtBasedBlackJack](txtBaseBlackJack)**
> Designed a text-based version of the popular card game "Blackjack," employing loops, functions, dictionaries, and the range function to simulate gameplay.

**[🔢🗣️🎮 |Day 12: numberGuesser](numberGuesser)**
> Implemented a number guessing game that utilizes global variables and challenges players to guess a randomly generated number.

**[🆙⏬ ↕️ |Day 14: Higher-or-Lower](HigherOrLower)**
> Created a game that challenges players to guess a secret number while providing debugging functionalities for a seamless gaming experience.

**[☕🤖 🖥️|Day 16: coffee-Machine-Software](coffeeMachineSoftware)**
> Developed a software solution for a coffee machine, focusing on the mechanics of Visual Studio Code (vsCode) and creating an intuitive terminal-based user interface.

**[☕🤖 OOP|Day 15: oop-coffee-Machine-Software](oop_coffeeMachineSoftware)**
> very similar to Day 16, just in an OOP manner.

**[💯❓🤔 |Day 17: OOP Quiz Game](oop_quizGame)**
> Built an Object-Oriented Quiz Game utilizing an external API to provide dynamic and engaging True/False questions for an interactive user experience.

**[🐢🖼️🎨|Day 19: turtleArtWorks](turtleArtWork)**
> Replicated David Hirst's **Flumequine** art work using turtle graphics and other cool geometry based artworks. 

**[🐍🕹️🎮|Day 20 & 21: snakeGame](snakePath)**
> Using OOP to replicate the classic snake xzneia game from the nokia phone.

**[🐍🕹️🎮|Day 22: pin-pong](snakePath)**
> Using OOP to replicate the classic pin-pong game. This game makes use of a scoreboard and updates player's points.
