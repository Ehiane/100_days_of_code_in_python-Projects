### Drawing Connected Polygon Shapes

> The code includes functions to draw connected polygon shapes, ranging from a triangle to a decagon. Each shape is filled with a randomly selected color, creating visually appealing geometric patterns. This feature demonstrates proficiency in creating modular and reusable code.

### Random Walk Art Generator

> The project includes a random walk art generator that creates unique and unpredictable patterns. The Turtle object moves in random directions, creating strokes of various lengths and colors. This feature showcases creativity and the ability to utilize randomness to generate artwork.

### Mesmerizing Spirograph Patterns

> The code allows you to generate captivating spirograph patterns. By specifying the gap size between each circle, the Turtle object draws intricate and symmetrical designs. This feature demonstrates an understanding of mathematical concepts and the ability to translate them into visual representations.

## Dependencies

The code relies on the following libraries:
- Turtle: `pip install turtle`
- Random: Already included in Python's standard library
- Colorgram: `pip install colorgram.py`

**Note:** The Colorgram library is used to extract colors from an image and generate the color list. Make sure to install this library before running the code.



### Importance of Documentation and Library Exploration

The project emphasizes the significance of documentation and the process of exploring new libraries. By referring to the Turtle documentation and experimenting with different functions and features, the code demonstrates the ability to learn and apply new technologies. This showcases adaptability, self-directed learning, and a growth mindset.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary libraries:
   - Turtle: `should be already built in with python 3.8, if not:`
     ```python
     pip install turtle
     ```
   - Random: Already included in Python's standard library
   - Colorgram: `pip install colorgram.py`

2. Import the required modules:
   - `import turtle as t`
   - `import random as r`
   - `import colorgram`

3. Set up the Turtle graphics window and create a Turtle object:
```python
  t.colormode(255)
  t.setup()
  screen = t.Screen()
  screen_size = t.screensize(2000, 2000, 'black')
  turtle = t.Turtle()
```


4. Extract colors from an image using Colorgram:
```
  rgb_colors = []
  colors = colorgram.extract('image.jpg', 30)
  for color in colors:
  r = color.rgb.r
  g = color.rgb.g
  b = color.rgb.b
  new_color = (r, g, b)
  rgb_colors.append(new_color)
```
Replace `'image.jpg'` with the path to the desired image. This code snippet generates the `color_list` using the Colorgram library.

5. Explore the different features:
- Drawing connected polygon shapes: Call the respective shape functions (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.) with the desired parameters.
- Random walk art generator: Call the `random_walk(obj)` function with the desired Turtle object.
- Spirograph: Call the `draw_spirograph(gap_size)` function with the desired gap size between each circle.

6. Run the code and observe the captivating artwork created by Turtle graphics.
