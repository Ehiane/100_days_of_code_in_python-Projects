This is a simple text-based calculator implemented in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Usage

The calculator can be used by executing the `source_code.py` file. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.


Follow the prompts to enter the numbers and select the desired operation. The calculator will display the result and give you the option to continue with the previous answer, start a new calculation, or quit the application.

## Dependencies

The calculator relies on the `dependencies.py` file, which contains the following dependencies:

- `logo`: A string representing the logo or header of the calculator.
- `clear_screen_command`: A command used to clear the screen and provide a cleaner interface.

The `clear_screen()` function in `dependencies.py` clears the screen by printing the appropriate escape characters.

## Customization

You can customize the calculator by modifying the `logo` string in `dependencies.py` to display your desired logo or header. Additionally, you can add or modify the operations in the `operations` dictionary in `dependencies.py` to support additional arithmetic operations.

Feel free to experiment and enhance the calculator according to your needs.
