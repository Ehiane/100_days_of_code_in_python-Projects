# Gameplay
The game follows the traditional rules of Rock Paper Scissors:

*Rock beats Scissors
*Paper beats Rock
*Scissors beats Paper
The player and the computer (CPU) make their choices by selecting from the available options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The choices are then compared to determine the winner of each round. The first player to reach a score of 5 wins the game.
