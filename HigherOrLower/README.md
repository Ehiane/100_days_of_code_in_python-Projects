# ↕️Higher or Lower

This is a Python program called "Higher or Lower" that allows users to play a guessing game based on the number of followers of different celebrities. The program presents two celebrities and asks the user to guess who has more followers on a social media platform. The user's score increases if the guess is correct, and the game continues until the user makes an incorrect guess.

## How to Play


1. Run the `source_code.py` file to start the game.
2. You will be presented with two celebrities and their information.
3. Guess which celebrity has more followers by entering the corresponding number (1 or 2).
4. If your guess is correct, your score will increase by 1.
5. The game will continue with new celebrities.
6. If your guess is incorrect, the game will end, and your final score will be displayed.
7. You can play again by running the `source_code.py` file.

## Dependencies

This program requires the following dependencies:
- `game_data.py`: Contains the data of celebrities and their followers.
- `game_functions.py`: Contains the necessary functions for the game.
- `art.py`: Contains ASCII art used in the game.

Please make sure all the required files are present in the same directory as the `source_code.py` file.

## How to Run the Program

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the `source_code.py` file is located.
4. Run the following command: `python source_code.py`

## Note

The data in the `game_data.py` file contains information about celebrities and their follower counts as of December 2021. The program randomly selects two celebrities for each round of the game.

Enjoy playing the "Higher or Lower" game!
