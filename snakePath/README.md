# üêçüïπÔ∏èüéÆ|Snake Game

This Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game built using Python and the Turtle graphics module. The game allows the player to control a snake and navigate it on the screen to eat food and grow in length. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Game Features

- Snake body: The game starts with a snake consisting of three squares, forming the snake's initial length.
- Snake motion: The snake moves continuously forward on the screen.
- Motion control: The player can control the snake's direction using the keyboard arrow keys.
- Food generation: Food is randomly generated on the screen for the snake to eat.
- Score tracking: The score is updated every time the snake eats food.
- HighScore retention: The highest score earned by the user can now be updated and rembered antime you play the game.
- Collision detection: The game detects collisions with the walls and the snake's own body, leading to game over.
- Game restart: The player can restart the game by pressing the spacebar when prompted.
